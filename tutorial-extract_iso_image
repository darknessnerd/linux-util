First youâ€™ll need to create a folder in which to mount the image, open your command line editor and enter:

sudo mkdir /mnt/iso

Enter you password when asked, and your directory will be created. Now we can mount the file by typing:

sudo mount -o loop <image>.iso /mnt/iso 

if this command fail try this

mount -o loop -t iso9660 <image>.iso /mnt/iso


Replace <image> with the location of your .ISO file

copy all the file into a folder 

sudo cp -r /mnt/iso /home/{user}/{folder}


after copy all files 

sudo unmount /mnt/iso
sudo rm -r /mnt/iso
