Having a bit of trouble attempting to enable users of a group within a container to write to a bind mount. I'm on Proxmox 5.1 and created a standard Ubuntu 17.10 container from the available template. I tried using the PVE page on unprivileged containers as a guide in attempting to enable write access and took the following steps:

    In /etc/pve/lxc/100.conf I added mp0: /vdata/media,mp=/media
    Changed the container UID mapping in the file /etc/pve/lxc/100.conf:

Code:

lxc.idmap = u 0 100000 2000
lxc.idmap = g 0 100000 2000
lxc.idmap = u 2000 2000 1
lxc.idmap = g 200 2000 1
lxc.idmap = u 2001 102001 63535
lxc.idmap = g 2001 102001 63535

    Added root:2000:1 to /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid on host to allow root to use the uid/gid in the container
    Created a new group called container-data and add root to the group:
    Code:

    addgroup --gid 2000 container-data
    usermod -aG container-data root

    Change group ownership on the host directory to container-data
    Code:

    chgrp -R container-data /vdata/media
    chmod g+w /vdata/media
    chmod g+s /vdata/media

    Inside the container, created a container-data group with the same GID and added users to it:
    Code:

    addgroup --gid 2000 container-data
    usermod -aG container-data root
    usermod -aG container-data service
    usermod -aG container-data david
